The app I built is designed to make it easy for users to log in, manage their data, and receive SMS notifications. Users can log in or create a new account with their information stored in a database. They can add, delete, or update items in the database, like inventory or event details. The app also asks for permission to send SMS alerts, like reminders or updates. If the user allows it, the app sends notifications but if they deny it, the app still works without the SMS feature.

To create the app, I used clear and organized code, tested it regularly, and followed best practices. An important part of the app was the database which lets users manage their information easily. I tested the app using Android Studio to make sure everything worked as planned. One challenge was handling the SMS permission request where I made sure the app still ran as intended even if the user denied the request. This process showed my ability to manage user data and make the app responsive to different situations.
